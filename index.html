            <p>Welcome to my website. My name is Md. Mutasim Farhan. I am currently a student at North South University.
                I
                am from ECE Department, and this is my 6th semester at NSU. I am proficient in three programming
                language -
                C, C++ and Java. I also know a little bit about Python. Currently, I am learning Web Development. I can
                code
                basic HTML and CSS. </p>

            <h1>Become a Web Developer</h1>
            <p>
                I want to become a skilled Web Developer. Unlike others who wants to be a Web Developer just for income
                purposes, I am someone who wants to learn Web Development only for my hobby. I want to create a
                wonderful site for my university mates. Also, I plan to work on different interesting project. I am
                currently a newbie learner, and I have completed HTML and CSS. I plan to explore other fields as soon as
                I can.

                <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
                <h3 class="font-color">2024-Present | Pro Level Developer</h3>
                <p>I am good at HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also know programming languages like C, C++, Java and
                    Python.
                    Beside
                    programming languagesm, I have a good idea about Data Structure and Algorithm using which I can make
                    my
                    website faster. I have a decent idea about server backend. I can create a secure and fast backend.

                <p>I am currently enrolled in the complete Web Development Course with Jhankar Mahbub. He teaches very
                    well.
                    The support session is great as well.To polish what we have learned in the entire module, a
                    conceptual
                    session is arranged, which is of great importance to me because I believe I can polish my existing
                    knowledge there. I currently know about HTML and CSS, and I am planning to learn JavaScript next. I
                    hope
                    to finish the course with maximum learning possible. I also wish to be a good web developer soon.
